# Stack References and Nested Stacks

* [Return to table of contents](../../../README.md)

* **Exam Tips:**
  * Cross Stack Referencing:
    * Shared common stacks that don't change, but need to be referenced from other stacks that are highly transactional.
    * Reused common stack
  * Nested Stacks:
    * For template reuse.
