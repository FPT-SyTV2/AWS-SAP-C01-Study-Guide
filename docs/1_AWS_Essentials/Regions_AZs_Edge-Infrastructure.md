# Regions, AZs, and Edge Infrastructure

* [Return to table of contents](../../README.md)

## Regions

* Regions help with fault isolation, but at a more macro scale.
* Protect against geo-political issues.

* **Example regions:**
  * us-east-1
  * us-west-1

## Availability Zones

* Own storage, compute, and network.
* Separate, isolated infrastructure components.
* Fault isolation domains.

* **Example availability zones:**
  * us-east-1a
  * us-east-1b
  * us-west-1a
  * us-west-1b

## Edge Locations

* Smalled pockets of infrastructure, distributed in major cities.
* Rack scale contain storage and content distribution capability.
