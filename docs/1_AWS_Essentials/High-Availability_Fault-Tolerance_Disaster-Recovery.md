# Information about High availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery

* [Return to table of contents](../../README.md)

* **Exam Tips:**
  * **High availability:**
    * Recover from a failure.
    * Does not mean avoiding all failures/faults.
    * Means taking steps to avoid failures, or minimize failures when they do happen, or recover more quickly from failures.
  * **Fault Tolerance:**
    * Have multiple redundancy.
    * Allow system to operate even if only one of the resources is  available.
    * System assumes failure and can run through failure.
    * More expense - parallel resources.
  * **Disaster Recovery:**
    * Solely concerned with protecting the existing data for use for recreating the systems.
