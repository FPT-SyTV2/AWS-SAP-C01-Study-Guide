# Information about High availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery

## High availability

* Recover from a failure.
* Does not mean avoiding all failures/faults.
* Means taking steps to avoid failures, or minimize failures when they do happen, or recover more quickly from failures.

## Fault Tolerance

* Have multiple reduancy
* Allow system to operate even if only one of the resources is available.
* System assumes failure and can run through failure.
* More expanse - parallel resources.

## Disaster Recovery

* Solely concerned with protecting the existing data for use for recreating the systems.
